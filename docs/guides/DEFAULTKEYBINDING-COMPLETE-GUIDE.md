## Introduction & Overview

### What is DefaultKeyBinding.dict?

DefaultKeyBinding.dict is macOS's system-wide text navigation configuration file that operates at the **Cocoa Text System level**. It provides consistent keyboard navigation across all native macOS applications that use the standard text system - from Safari form fields to TextEdit documents to Finder rename dialogs.

This operates as **Layer -1** in our comprehensive keyboard philosophy:

```
Layer -1: macOS Text System (DefaultKeyBinding.dict) ← YOU ARE HERE
Layer 0:  System UI (Full Keyboard Access)
Layer 1:  Hardware (Karabiner Elements)  
Layer 2:  Application (Per-App Configs)
Layer 3:  Editor (Vim/IdeaVim)
```

### Key Advantages

- **Universal Coverage**: Works in ALL Cocoa text fields system-wide
- **No Installation**: Just place file in `~/Library/KeyBindings/`
- **Deep Integration**: Operates at the framework level
- **Multi-Stroke Support**: Complex key sequences possible
- **Kill Ring**: Built-in text buffer system like Emacs
- **Immediate Effect**: Active after app restart

### Limitations

- **Cocoa Only**: Doesn't affect Terminal, some Electron apps
- **Text Fields Only**: No window management or system controls
- **Limited Command Key**: System often intercepts ⌘ combinations
- **No Conditionals**: Cannot detect context or application
- **Static Config**: No runtime modification possible

## Technical Foundation

### NSStandardKeyBindingResponding Protocol

DefaultKeyBinding.dict leverages the NSStandardKeyBindingResponding protocol, which defines ~100+ methods for text manipulation. Every Cocoa text control (NSTextField, NSTextView, etc.) implements these methods.

### File Location and Format

```bash
# Create directory if needed
mkdir -p ~/Library/KeyBindings/

# File location (system-wide)
~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict

# Format: XML Property List or NeXTSTEP format
```

### Basic Structure

```
{
    /* Key = Action mapping */
    "key_combination" = "method_name:";
    
    /* Multi-stroke sequences */
    "prefix_key" = {
        "second_key" = "method_name:";
    };
}
```

### Activation

1. Save file to `~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict`
2. Restart applications to load new bindings
3. Or log out/in for system-wide effect

    /* Key combinations */
    "^~$a" = "methodName:";      /* Control-Option-Shift-A */
}
```

## Multi-Stroke Bindings

### Nested Dictionary Syntax

Multi-stroke bindings use nested dictionaries where the first key opens a submenu of additional key options.

#### Basic Multi-Stroke
```
{
    /* Escape as meta key (Emacs style) */
    "\033" = {
        "f" = "moveWordForward:";      /* ESC f */
        "b" = "moveWordBackward:";     /* ESC b */  
        "d" = "deleteWordForward:";    /* ESC d */
        "<" = "moveToBeginningOfDocument:"; /* ESC < */
        ">" = "moveToEndOfDocument:";  /* ESC > */
    };
}
```

#### Control-X Sequences (Emacs)
```
{
    "^x" = {
        "^s" = "save:";               /* C-x C-s */
        "^c" = "terminate:";          /* C-x C-c */  
        "^f" = "openDocument:";       /* C-x C-f */
        "^w" = "saveDocumentAs:";     /* C-x C-w */
        "b"  = "selectNextKeyView:";  /* C-x b */
        "k"  = "performClose:";       /* C-x k */
    };
}
```

#### Space as Leader Key
```
{
    " " = {
        /* Navigation */
        "h" = "moveToBeginningOfLine:";
        "l" = "moveToEndOfLine:"; 
        "j" = "moveToEndOfDocument:";
        "k" = "moveToBeginningOfDocument:";
        
        /* Word movement */
        "w" = "moveWordForward:";
        "b" = "moveWordBackward:";
        
        /* Selection */
        "v" = "selectWord:";
        "V" = "selectLine:";
        
        /* Deletion */
        "d" = {
            "d" = "selectLine:, deleteBackward:";  /* Space d d */
            "w" = "deleteWordForward:";            /* Space d w */
            "$" = "deleteToEndOfLine:";            /* Space d $ */
        };
    };
}
```

### Complex Sequences

#### Vim-Style Text Objects
```
{
    /* d (delete) prefix */
    "d" = {
        "d" = "selectLine:, deleteBackward:";     /* dd - delete line */
        "w" = "deleteWordForward:";               /* dw - delete word */  
        "$" = "deleteToEndOfLine:";               /* d$ - delete to end */
        "^" = "deleteToBeginningOfLine:";         /* d^ - delete to start */
    };
    
    /* c (change) prefix */  
    "c" = {
        "w" = "deleteWordForward:, insertText:"; /* cw - change word */
        "$" = "deleteToEndOfLine:, insertText:"; /* c$ - change to end */
    };
}
```

#### Mode Switching
```
{
    /* Enter navigation mode */
    "\033" = "setNavigationMode:";      /* ESC enters nav mode */
    
    /* Navigation mode bindings */
    "navigationMode" = {
        "h" = "moveBackward:";
        "j" = "moveDown:";  
        "k" = "moveUp:";
        "l" = "moveForward:";
        "i" = "exitNavigationMode:";    /* i returns to insert */
    };
}
```

### Timeout Behavior

Multi-stroke sequences have a timeout (typically 1-2 seconds). If no second key is pressed within the timeout, the first key is processed normally.

## HJKL Navigation Implementation

### Basic HJKL Movement

```
{
    /* Vim-style navigation */
    "h" = "moveBackward:";              /* h → left */
    "j" = "moveDown:";                  /* j → down */
    "k" = "moveUp:";                    /* k → up */  
    "l" = "moveForward:";               /* l → right */
}
```

### Selection with HJKL

```
{
    /* Movement with selection (Shift equivalent) */
    "$h" = "moveBackwardAndModifySelection:";  /* Shift-h */
    "$j" = "moveDownAndModifySelection:";      /* Shift-j */
    "$k" = "moveUpAndModifySelection:";        /* Shift-k */
    "$l" = "moveForwardAndModifySelection:";   /* Shift-l */
}
```

### Word Movement (Option modifier semantic)

```
{
    /* Word-level movement (Option semantic) */
    "~h" = "moveWordBackward:";         /* Option-h → word left */
    "~l" = "moveWordForward:";          /* Option-l → word right */
    "~j" = "moveParagraphForward:";     /* Option-j → paragraph down */
    "~k" = "moveParagraphBackward:";    /* Option-k → paragraph up */
}
```

### Combined Modifiers

```
{
    /* Word selection (Option + Shift) */
    "~$h" = "moveWordBackwardAndModifySelection:";
    "~$l" = "moveWordForwardAndModifySelection:";
    "~$j" = "moveParagraphForwardAndModifySelection:";
    "~$k" = "moveParagraphBackwardAndModifySelection:";
}
```

### Line Navigation

```
{
    /* Line boundaries */
    "0" = "moveToBeginningOfLine:";     /* 0 → line start */
    "$" = "moveToEndOfLine:";           /* $ → line end */
    "^" = "moveToBeginningOfLine:";     /* ^ → line start (alt) */
}
```

### Document Navigation

```
{
    /* Document boundaries */
    "g" = {
        "g" = "moveToBeginningOfDocument:"; /* gg → doc start */
    };
    "G" = "moveToEndOfDocument:";           /* G → doc end */
}
```

### Complete HJKL System

```
{
    /* ===== BASIC MOVEMENT ===== */
    "h" = "moveBackward:";
    "j" = "moveDown:"; 
    "k" = "moveUp:";
    "l" = "moveForward:";
    
    /* ===== SELECTION (Shift semantic) ===== */
    "$h" = "moveBackwardAndModifySelection:";
    "$j" = "moveDownAndModifySelection:";
    "$k" = "moveUpAndModifySelection:";
    "$l" = "moveForwardAndModifySelection:";
    
    /* ===== WORD MOVEMENT (Option semantic) ===== */
    "~h" = "moveWordBackward:";
    "~j" = "moveParagraphForward:";
    "~k" = "moveParagraphBackward:";  
    "~l" = "moveWordForward:";
    
    /* ===== WORD SELECTION (Option + Shift) ===== */
    "~$h" = "moveWordBackwardAndModifySelection:";
    "~$j" = "moveParagraphForwardAndModifySelection:";
    "~$k" = "moveParagraphBackwardAndModifySelection:";
    "~$l" = "moveWordForwardAndModifySelection:";
    
    /* ===== ADDITIONAL VIM KEYS ===== */
    "w" = "moveWordForward:";           /* w → next word */
    "b" = "moveWordBackward:";          /* b → previous word */
    "e" = "moveWordRightAndModifySelection:"; /* e → word end */
    
    /* ===== LINE NAVIGATION ===== */
    "0" = "moveToBeginningOfLine:";     /* 0 → line start */
    "$" = "moveToEndOfLine:";           /* $ → line end */
    "^" = "moveToBeginningOfLine:";     /* ^ → line start */
    
    /* ===== DOCUMENT NAVIGATION ===== */  
    "g" = {
        "g" = "moveToBeginningOfDocument:"; /* gg → top */
    };
    "G" = "moveToEndOfDocument:";       /* G → bottom */
    
    /* ===== PAGE NAVIGATION ===== */
    "^u" = "pageUp:";                   /* Ctrl-u → page up */
    "^d" = "pageDown:";                 /* Ctrl-d → page down */
    "^b" = "pageUp:";                   /* Ctrl-b → page up (alt) */
    "^f" = "pageDown:";                 /* Ctrl-f → page down (alt) */
}
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Kill Ring Implementation

The kill ring is macOS's equivalent to Vim's unnamed register - a text buffer separate from the clipboard.

```
{
    /* Kill ring operations (Emacs style) */
    "^k" = "deleteToEndOfLine:";        /* C-k kills to end of line */
    "^w" = "deleteBackward:";           /* C-w kills selected text */
    "^y" = "yank:";                     /* C-y yanks from kill ring */
    "~y" = "yankAndSelect:";            /* M-y yank and select */
    
    /* Kill word operations */
    "~d" = "deleteWordForward:";        /* M-d kill word forward */
    "~\177" = "deleteWordBackward:";    /* M-DEL kill word backward */
    
    /* Kill line operations */  
    "^a" = "moveToBeginningOfLine:";    /* C-a move to start */
    "^e" = "moveToEndOfLine:";          /* C-e move to end */
    "^k" = "deleteToEndOfLine:";        /* C-k kill to end */
    "^u" = "deleteToBeginningOfLine:";  /* C-u kill to start */
}
```

### Mark and Region Operations

```
{
    /* Mark operations (Emacs style) */
    "^ " = "setMark:";                  /* C-SPC set mark */
    "^@" = "setMark:";                  /* C-@ set mark (alt) */
    "^x^x" = "swapWithMark:";          /* C-x C-x swap mark/cursor */
    "^w" = "deleteToMark:";             /* C-w cut region to kill ring */
    "~w" = "selectToMark:";             /* M-w copy region to kill ring */
    
    /* Region selection shortcuts */
    "selectCurrentWord" = "setMark:, moveWordForward:, swapWithMark:";
    "selectCurrentLine" = "moveToBeginningOfLine:, setMark:, moveToEndOfLine:";
}
```

### Text Transformation Chains

```
{
    /* Case transformation sequences */
    "~c" = "capitalizeWord:, moveWordForward:";     /* M-c capitalize word */
    "~u" = "uppercaseWord:, moveWordForward:";      /* M-u uppercase word */ 
    "~l" = "lowercaseWord:, moveWordForward:";      /* M-l lowercase word */
    
    /* Transpose operations */
    "^t" = "transpose:";                            /* C-t transpose chars */
    "~t" = "transposeWords:";                       /* M-t transpose words */
    
    /* Smart quote replacement */
    "\"" = "insertDoubleQuoteIgnoringSubstitution:";
    "'" = "insertSingleQuoteIgnoringSubstitution:";
}
```

### Space-Based Leader System

```
{
    " " = {
        /* ===== FILES ===== */
        "f" = {
            "f" = "openDocument:";           /* Space f f */
            "s" = "saveDocument:";           /* Space f s */
            "w" = "saveDocumentAs:";         /* Space f w */
        };
        
        /* ===== NAVIGATION ===== */
        "g" = {
            "g" = "moveToBeginningOfDocument:";  /* Space g g */
            "e" = "moveToEndOfDocument:";        /* Space g e */  
            "l" = "moveToEndOfLine:";            /* Space g l */
            "h" = "moveToBeginningOfLine:";      /* Space g h */
        };
        
        /* ===== WINDOWS ===== */
        "w" = {
            "s" = "insertNewline:";              /* Space w s (split) */
            "v" = "insertTab:";                  /* Space w v (vsplit) */  
            "q" = "performClose:";               /* Space w q (quit) */
        };
        
        /* ===== SEARCH ===== */
        "s" = {
            "s" = "centerSelectionInVisibleArea:";  /* Space s s */
            "/" = "complete:";                      /* Space s / */
        };
        
        /* ===== TEXT OBJECTS ===== */
        "v" = {
            "w" = "selectWord:";                 /* Space v w */
            "l" = "selectLine:";                 /* Space v l */
            "p" = "selectParagraph:";            /* Space v p */
            "a" = "selectAll:";                  /* Space v a */
        };
    };
}
```

### Conditional-Style Bindings

While true conditionals aren't supported, you can create mode-like behavior:

```
{
    /* Mode toggle approach */
    "^[" = "setNavigationMode:";         /* ESC → navigation mode */
    
    /* In navigation mode, override normal keys */
    "navigationModeActive" = {
        "h" = "moveBackward:";
        "j" = "moveDown:";
        "k" = "moveUp:"; 
        "l" = "moveForward:";
        "i" = "clearNavigationMode:";    /* i → back to insert mode */
        "v" = "setVisualMode:";          /* v → visual mode */
    };
    
    /* Visual mode */
    "visualModeActive" = {
        "h" = "moveBackwardAndModifySelection:";
        "j" = "moveDownAndModifySelection:";
        "k" = "moveUpAndModifySelection:";
        "l" = "moveForwardAndModifySelection:";
        "d" = "deleteBackward:, clearVisualMode:";
        "y" = "copy:, clearVisualMode:";
        "\033" = "clearVisualMode:";     /* ESC exits visual */
    };
}
```

## Integration Strategies

### Coordination with Karabiner Elements

DefaultKeyBinding.dict works **in combination** with Karabiner, not in conflict. Here's how to coordinate:

#### Layer Responsibility Matrix

| Function | DefaultKeyBinding.dict | Karabiner Elements | Winner |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Text navigation | ✅ HJKL in text fields | ✅ HJKL system-wide | Both (different contexts) |
| Dual-role keys | ❌ No support | ✅ A/S/D/F modifiers | Karabiner |
| Window management | ❌ No support | ✅ Hyper+HJKL | Karabiner |
| App switching | ❌ No support | ✅ ✱+Tab | Karabiner |
| Mouse control | ❌ No support | ✅ Hyper+mouse | Karabiner |
| Text editing | ✅ NSResponder methods | ❌ Limited | DefaultKeyBinding |

#### Coordinated Configuration

**Karabiner**: Handles hardware-level remapping
```json
{
    "description": "Dual-role ASDF + HJKL navigation",
    "manipulators": [
        {
            "type": "basic",
            "from": {"key_code": "a"},
            "to": [{"key_code": "a"}],
            "to_if_held_down": [{"key_code": "left_shift"}]
        }
    ]
}
```

**DefaultKeyBinding.dict**: Handles text-specific operations
```
{
    /* Text navigation (works WITH Karabiner dual-role) */
    "h" = "moveBackward:";
    "j" = "moveDown:";
    
    /* Use Karabiner's dual-role modifiers */  
    "~h" = "moveWordBackward:";     /* Option-h via Karabiner D key */
    "^h" = "moveToBeginningOfLine:"; /* Control-h via Karabiner S key */
}
```

### Avoiding System Shortcut Conflicts

#### Safe Modifier Combinations
```
/* SAFE - Rarely used by system */
"~h", "~j", "~k", "~l"           /* Option + HJKL */
"^~h", "^~j", "^~k", "^~l"       /* Control-Option + HJKL */
"\033h", "\033j"                 /* Escape + key */

/* RISKY - Often intercepted */
"^c", "^v", "^x", "^z"          /* System shortcuts */
"@c", "@v", "@x", "@z"          /* Command shortcuts */  
"^@h", "^@j", "^@k", "^@l"      /* Command-Control combinations */
```

#### Testing for Conflicts
```bash
# Test in various apps
open -a TextEdit
open -a Safari  
open -a "System Preferences"

# Check for conflicts in each
```

### Application Compatibility Matrix

| Application Type | Support Level | Notes |
|-----------------|---------------|-------|
| **Native Cocoa** | ✅ Full | TextEdit, Mail, Safari forms |
| **Carbon Apps** | ⚠️ Partial | Some older Mac apps |
| **Terminal Apps** | ❌ None | Terminal, iTerm don't use Cocoa text |
| **Electron Apps** | ⚠️ Partial | VS Code, Slack - inconsistent |
| **Java Apps** | ⚠️ Partial | IntelliJ IDEA - limited support |
| **Web Browsers** | ✅ Good | Safari, Chrome form fields |
| **Cross-Platform** | ⚠️ Varies | Apps using custom text rendering |

#### Per-Application Adjustments

**For Terminal**: Use separate terminal-specific configs
```bash
# ~/.inputrc for readline
set editing-mode vi
```

**For VS Code**: Use VS Code keybindings.json
```json
{
    "key": "h",
    "command": "cursorLeft",
    "when": "vim.active && vim.mode == 'Normal'"
}
```

**For Browsers**: DefaultKeyBinding.dict works in form fields, combine with browser extensions for full page navigation.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Basic Vim-Style Navigation

Perfect for users wanting simple HJKL navigation in text fields:

```
{
    /* Basic movement */
    "h" = "moveBackward:";
    "j" = "moveDown:";
    "k" = "moveUp:";
    "l" = "moveForward:";
    
    /* Word movement */  
    "w" = "moveWordForward:";
    "b" = "moveWordBackward:";
    
    /* Line navigation */
    "0" = "moveToBeginningOfLine:";
    "$" = "moveToEndOfLine:";
    
    /* Delete operations */
    "x" = "deleteForward:";
    "X" = "deleteBackward:";
    
    /* Document navigation */
    "g" = {
        "g" = "moveToBeginningOfDocument:";
    };
    "G" = "moveToEndOfDocument:";
}
```

### Example 2: Emacs-Style Configuration

Complete Emacs emulation with kill ring and mark operations:

```
{
    /* ===== MOVEMENT ===== */
    "^f" = "moveForward:";              /* C-f → forward char */

    "^d" = "deleteForward:";             /* C-d → delete char */
    "^h" = "deleteBackward:";            /* C-h → delete backward */
    "~d" = "deleteWordForward:";         /* M-d → delete word */
    "~\177" = "deleteWordBackward:";     /* M-DEL → delete word back */
    "^u" = "deleteToBeginningOfLine:";   /* C-u → delete to start */
    
    /* ===== MARK AND REGION ===== */
    "^ " = "setMark:";                   /* C-SPC → set mark */
    "^@" = "setMark:";                   /* C-@ → set mark */
    "^x^x" = "swapWithMark:";           /* C-x C-x → exchange mark */
    
    /* ===== CASE CHANGES ===== */

    "~u" = "uppercaseWord:, moveWordForward:";   /* M-u → uppercase */
    "~l" = "lowercaseWord:, moveWordForward:";   /* M-l → lowercase */
    
    /* ===== TRANSPOSE ===== */
    "^t" = "transpose:";                 /* C-t → transpose chars */
    "~t" = "transposeWords:";            /* M-t → transpose words */
    
    /* ===== SEARCH ===== */
    "^s" = "complete:";                  /* C-s → search/complete */
    "^r" = "complete:";                  /* C-r → reverse search */

        "\177" = "deleteWordBackward:";  /* ESC DEL → delete word back */
    };
}
```

### Example 3: Space Leader System

Modern modal editing with Space as leader key:

```

### Example 4: Hybrid System (Recommended)

Combines best of all approaches for maximum flexibility:

    "j" = "moveDown:";  
    "k" = "moveUp:";

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Bindings Not Working

**Problem**: Keys don't trigger the expected actions
**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check file location
ls -la ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict

# Verify file permissions  
chmod 644 ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict

# Check syntax with plutil
plutil ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict

# Restart application
killall TextEdit
open -a TextEdit
```

#### 2. Syntax Errors

**Problem**: File doesn't load due to syntax issues
**Solutions**:
```bash
# Validate property list syntax
plutil -lint ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict

# Check for common issues:
# - Missing semicolons after method names
# - Unmatched braces { }
# - Incorrect quote escaping
# - Missing commas in nested dictionaries
```

**Common Syntax Errors**:
```
/* WRONG */
{
    "h" = "moveBackward"     // Missing colon
    "j" = "moveDown:";       // Missing comma
    "k" = 'moveUp:';         // Wrong quotes  
}

/* CORRECT */
{
    "h" = "moveBackward:";
    "j" = "moveDown:";
    "k" = "moveUp:";
}
```

#### 3. Conflicts with System Shortcuts

**Problem**: System intercepts key combinations
**Solutions**:
```
/* Avoid problematic combinations */
"@c" = "copy:";              // ⌘C intercepted by system
"^c" = "cancelOperation:";   // Ctrl-C intercepted by Terminal

/* Use safer alternatives */
"~c" = "copy:";              // Option-C safer
"^~c" = "copy:";             // Ctrl-Option-C very safe
"\033c" = "copy:";           // ESC-C always safe
```

#### 4. Application-Specific Issues

**Problem**: Works in some apps but not others

| App | Issue | Solution |
|-----|--------|----------|
| Terminal | No Cocoa text system | Use terminal-specific configs |
| VS Code | Electron app limitations | Configure VS Code keybindings.json |
| Browsers | Partial form field support | Use browser extensions |
| Java apps | Limited Cocoa integration | May need app-specific config |

### Testing Methodology

#### 1. Systematic Testing
```bash
# Test in multiple apps
apps=("TextEdit" "Safari" "Mail" "System Preferences")
for app in "${apps[@]}"; do
    echo "Testing in $app"
    open -a "$app"
    # Test your key combinations
done
```

#### 2. Debugging Specific Keys
```
{
    /* Add debug bindings to test */
    "h" = "insertText: LEFT";     /* Should type "LEFT" */
    "j" = "insertText: DOWN";     /* Should type "DOWN" */
    
    /* Then change back to real actions */
    "h" = "moveBackward:";
    "j" = "moveDown:";
}
```

#### 3. Incremental Development
```
/* Start minimal */
{
    "h" = "moveBackward:";
    "l" = "moveForward:";
}

/* Add one feature at a time */
{
    "h" = "moveBackward:";
    "l" = "moveForward:";
    "j" = "moveDown:";          // ADD
    "k" = "moveUp:";            // ADD
}

/* Test after each addition */
```

### Performance Considerations

#### 1. File Size
- Large files load slower
- Keep under 1000 lines for best performance
- Complex nested dictionaries add overhead

#### 2. Multi-Stroke Efficiency
```
/* EFFICIENT - shallow nesting */
{
    " " = {
        "h" = "moveToBeginningOfLine:";
        "l" = "moveToEndOfLine:";
    };
}

/* INEFFICIENT - deep nesting */
{
    " " = {
        "g" = {
            "g" = {
                "h" = "moveToBeginningOfLine:";
            };
        };
    };
}
```

### Advanced Tips

#### 1. Method Chaining
Some methods can be chained with commas:
```
{
    "dd" = "selectLine:, deleteBackward:";  /* Select line then delete */
    "yy" = "selectLine:, copy:";            /* Select line then copy */
}
```

#### 2. Unicode Input
```
{
    /* Insert special characters */
    "~1" = "insertText: ™";           /* Option-1 → trademark */
    "~2" = "insertText: €";           /* Option-2 → euro */
    "~e" = "insertText: é";           /* Option-e → accent */
}
```

#### 3. Context-Specific Workarounds
```
{
    /* Different behavior per context */
    "h" = "moveBackward:";                    /* Normal text */
    "^h" = "deleteBackward:";                 /* Terminal-like */
    "\033h" = "moveWordBackward:";            /* Advanced users */
}
```

#### 4. Migration Strategy
```bash
# Backup existing settings
cp ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict ~/Desktop/backup.dict

# Start with minimal config
echo '{"h" = "moveBackward:";}' > ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict

# Gradually add features
# Test extensively
# Document what works
```

### Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic HJKL, add complexity gradually
2. **Document Everything**: Comment your bindings extensively
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify in multiple applications
4. **Version Control**: Keep your config in git
5. **Backup Regularly**: Save working configurations
6. **Stay Conservative**: Avoid complex nested sequences initially
7. **Consider Users**: If sharing configs, include installation instructions

### Useful Resources

- **Apple Documentation**: Text System Defaults and Key Bindings
- **GitHub Examples**: Search "DefaultKeyBinding.dict" for inspiration
- **Testing Apps**: TextEdit, Safari, Mail are good test environments
- **Debugging**: Use plutil for syntax validation
- **Community**: Reddit r/vim, r/emacs for configuration ideas
